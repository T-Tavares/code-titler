# Change Log

All notable changes to the "code-title" extension will be documented in this file.
This is a initial release. If you find any bug or if you have any suggestion I'll be happy to check.
Open an Github Issue and let's make this extension better.

## Updates

-   Add colour and style to your titles and subtitles - Colour, Font Weight, Font Style and Background colour
-   Now if the language is not on the list of supported ones the title will fall back to the personalised tag

## Unreleased

-   Keep Code on the same identation it was created/called.
-   Accept more than one character on the title filling setting.
-   Recalculate size of current titles.
-   Recognise JSX within a react component and add the title with the proper syntax
